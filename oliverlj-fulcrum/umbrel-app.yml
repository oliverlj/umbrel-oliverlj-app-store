version: "1.8.2-build-1"
tagline: A fast & nimble SPV server for Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin BTC, and Litecoin
description: >
  Fast: Written in 100% modern C++17 using multi-threaded and asynchronous programming techniques.
  A drop-in replacement for ElectronX/ElectrumX: Fulcrum is 100% protocol-level compatible with the 
  Electrum Cash 1.4.5 protocol. Existing server admins should feel right at home with this software 
  since installation and management of it is nearly identical to ElectronX/ElectrumX server.
  Cross-platform: While this codebase was mainly developed and tested on MacOS, Windows and Linux,
  it should theoretically work on any modern OS (such as *BSD) that has Qt5 Core and Qt5 Networking available.
